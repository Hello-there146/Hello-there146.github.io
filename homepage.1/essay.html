          <h1>Charm of the Park</h1>
          <div class="paragrah-text">
            <p>
              Places that are unique, full of life, and important to people can be found all over the five boroughs and they all play a part in forming our own unique and personal New York. By far the most influential place that first shaped and continues to shape my New York is Astoria Park in Queens. Since Astoria Park has not only a wide variety of stunning views, but also a chill and relaxing environment, it attracts all kinds of people and serves as a place where memories can accumulate.

              Imagine for a moment that it is still your first week within the new and seemingly endlessly expansive city of New York and you are not yet accustomed to its wonders; then one day you get to visit a park close by that you have never been to before. Once you walk in you are greeted by the enormous Hell’s Gate Bridge overhead, stunning view of greenery, as well as a track and skate park straight ahead of you. The wise trees stand tall having endured the test of time through many rigorous seasons; the sky is crystal clear without a cloud in sight; just the sun beaming down on you through the shade provided by the trees, and further ahead, just past the skate park you see a breathtaking view of the Manhattan skyline. Awe and admiration. That was my first experience. 
            </p>
            <p>
              But nothing much has changed; the Hell’s gate bridge is still there making you hear that New York City traffic noise even though it's impossible to hear it from the distance you stand at, the trees are still just as strong and just as plentiful, and the skyline is if anything even more majestic than the last time you saw it, especially in the night time with the city across the glistening river providing it ever radiant and lively glow.

              Now would probably be the best time to mention that this park is big. HUGE even. Even with my visits on a weekly basis I can still find more things to do and tons more things to like about the park. While all these locations are different because of what they offer and the usual crowd occupying them they all share one special thing in common, something that can not only be said for the environment of the park, but the people as well; it is comforting and relaxing. Despite the fact that the entire park maintains this chill mood, the place that embodies this best is a set of benches beautifully placed under an elder tree overlooking the river with a view of the city as well, and a chipped yet complete engraved stone chess board as the table. I would spend hours here with friends playing card games like Uno, Yu-Gi-Oh, poker, blackjack, spit, and any other game that came to mind. Fulfilment, a feeling of being whole. That is the best way to describe how I felt during those times. Sure, the moments passed. But I’ll remember them. They will remember them. And the park will never forget.

              Walking around the humongous park you can see several things, like the many types of activities available and workouts to do, but the one thing that sticks out the most is the people. Everyone in this park has their own life, their own views, their own personality, their own story; and here, in this park, race, gender, religion, ethnicity, age, and any other social restriction do not matter. Here, in this park, you are able to connect with people without even saying a word. Just sharing the sentiment and peace that is derived from being in the park is enough for you to form a connection. An unspoken bond. A shared respect for those around you. This park offers a welcoming environment for everyone where anyone can come and enjoy some time alone in several places with great views, get some exercise in with the multitude of options offered, or even play some basketball with people and socialize with the friendly crowds that frequent the park; point is, whether you are a long time attender, or a recent one, you still can feel that sense of shared connection and warmth in the air ever present in the community as a whole.

              Taking a trip around Astoria Park by yourself or with friends will undoubtedly lead to either creating new memories that can be treasured and stored by the park, or reminiscing on the nostalgia while walking past places that contain those memories. The bench I played card games with my friends on, the patch of concrete that gave me a scar on my knee, the tree I hurt myself trying to climbing, the pull up bar I always try to beat my record on, the seemingly endless road along the Hudson; all of these things, while not special to others, are things I treasure and adore because their sentimental value as well as the effect they have on me. Others may see a skate park; I see an obstacle that I overcame and mastered. Others may see a field with slightly overgrown grass; I see the place my drone crash landed. Others may see a simple patch of dirt; I see the place my favorite beach towel laid while the night sky was illuminated by countless fireworks whose light paled in comparison to the hope and creativity my eyes shone with. And all of this, from a simple walk. Every step taken, another memory recalled. Every moment elapsed a new memory formed. The park in its infinite knowledge and capacity will remember even if everyone forgets about it; even if it is replaced, it will take those treasured memories with it and hold them tighter evermore.
